# Language

## What is language?

No easy, complete, specific way to define language

- *Complete*: captures *all* features of language
- *Specific*: captures *only* features of language

## What is language

### Language as an object

**Finite system of symbols**

*A language*: Catalan, English, Japanese Sign Language, 

## What is language

### Language as an object

Finite system of **symbols**

*Words* hold arbitrary relationship between form and meaning

## What is language

### Language as an object

**Finite** system of symbols

**Limited number of words** in a language

## What is language

### Language as an object

Finite **system** of symbols

Words^[and other linguistic units] are **combined in systematic ways**, following rules we know as **grammar**

## What is language

### Language as a function

Ability to systematically combine (**grammar**) a finite set of symbols (**words**) provided by a language so that a virtually ilimited number of sentences can be created (**productivity**).

## What is language like?

**Linguistics**: scientific study of language(s)

## What is language like?

Languages are made of different **linguistic units**.

Linguistic units are **organised hierarchically**.

## What is language like?

0) **Phonemes**: speech sounds that distinguish words with different meaning:

>/'ka.za/ vs. /'ka.sa/

[International Phonology Association (IPA)](https://www.ipachart.com/)

## What is language like?

0) **Phonemes**: speech sounds that distinguish words with different meaning.

phonemes ≠ letters

>casa: 4 letters, 4 phonemes (/kaza/) 
>coche: 5 letters, 4 phonemes (/kaza/) 

## What is language like?

## What is language like?

1) **Syllables**
2) **Words**: minimal unit of meaning. Form-meaning association.

0) **Phonemes**
1) **Syllables**
2) **Words**
3) **Sentences**: words organised into grammatically coherent structures. Maximal unit of speech production.

## What is language for?

Language provides clear evolutionary advantages


## What is language for?

### Language as a tool for communication

The ability for complex thinking provided humans with the ability to learn language [@fedorenko2024language; @hockett1960origin; @kirby2008cumulative].

Claims:

- Complex thinking does not necessarily engage language-related brain areas and vice versa (double dissociation) [@fedorenko2024language]

## What is language for?

### Language as a tool for thinking

The ability to use language provided humans with complex thinking [@chomsky2014minimalist; @goldin2003thought].

Claims:

- (Some forms of) thinking require or are facilitated by language [e.g., @lupyan2007language]


## Where does language come from?

Symbolic communication appears between 1,000,000 and 100,000 years ago (*Homo erectus*)^[@barham2021semiotics].

**Why? How?** Two approaches:

* Language "appears" [@berwick2016only; @chomsky2014minimalist]
* Language develops [@tomasello2003constructing; @christiansen2003language]

## Where does language come from?

Can only be investigated *indirectly*:

- Sparse archaeological evidence
- Cultural transmission and evolution
- Evolutionary biology


# Language ontogeny

## Is language *learned*?

* Humans need exposure to language to acquire language
* Not all humans speak the same language, and genes do not explain such differences

## Is language *inherited*?

* Humans acquire their native language(s) in little time, without effort, and without explicit instruction
* *Stimulus poverty*: language cannot be possible learnt from experience alone (lack of positive and negative evidence)
* Language is unique to humans, non-human animals do not acquire language even after intensive training

## Current views on language ontogeny

Which aspects are more experience dependent?

Which experience do they depend on?

Which mechanisms underlie language learning?

To what extent do humans share these mechanisms with other species?

# Before-birth

Pre-natal language acquisition

## Acoustics in the womb

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWBgy55EkIM >}}

## Acoustics in the womb

* Biological tissues filter the acoustic signal
* Low-pass filter: lower frequencies reach the fetus' ears, higher frequencies don't

## Fetal auditory development

* Auditory system functional by 24 weeks of gestation
* Fetus' get familiarized with prosodic features of their native language(s)
    + Intonation: modulation of the frequency of speech sounds across segments
    + Rhythm: rate at which linguistic units are produce per unit of time
* Still unfamiliar with segmental information (i.e., different consonants)

# 0-6 months of age

## First encounters with language

Infants show a preference towards speech, compared to non-speech sounds [@voloumanos].

## Language discrimination

Neonates can discriminate between languages from different rhythm classes [@mehler1988precursor; @nazzi1998language].

## Language discrimination

Neonates can discriminate between languages from different rhythm classes [@mehler1988precursor; @nazzi1998language].

**Nazzi et al. (1998)**

* Presented newborns with low-pass filtered sentences produced by natural speakersc (keeping prosodic but not segmental information)
* Sentences belonged to a stress-timed (English, Dutch) or a mora-timed (Japanese) language

## Language discrimination

## Perceptual narrowing

From 6 to 12 months of age, infants attune their perceptual abilities to the sounds of their native language [@werker1984crosslanguage].

**Werker and Tees (1984)**

Three groups of participants:

* 6 month-old infants
* English native adults
* Thompson (*Nlaka'pamuctsin*, native American) native adults
