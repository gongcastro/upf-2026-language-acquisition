## What is language for?

**Language as a tool for *communication***

<br>

The ability for complex thinking provided humans with the ability to learn language [@fedorenko_language_2024; @hockett1960origin; @kirby2008cumulative].

Complex thinking does not necessarily engage language-related brain areas and vice versa (double dissociation) [@fedorenko_language_2024]

:::
::: {.column}
**Language as a tool for *thinking***

<br>

The ability to use language provided humans with complex thinking [@chomsky2014minimalist; @goldin2003thought].

Some forms of thinking require or are facilitated by language [e.g., @lupyan_language_2007]
:::
:::


## Where does language come from?

<br>
<br>

Symbolic communication appears between 1,000,000 and 100,000 years ago (*Homo erectus*) [@barham_semiotics_2021].

<br>

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

**Why? How?** Two approaches:

* Language "appears"

[@berwick2016only; @chomsky2014minimalist]

* Language develops

[@tomasello2003constructing; @christiansen2003language]

:::
::: {.column}

- Sparse archaeological evidence
- Cultural transmission and evolution
- Evolutionary biology

# Language [acquisition]{style="background: black;color: white;"}


## Is language *learned*? 

<br>
<br>

::: {.incremental}
* Humans need **exposure** to language to acquire language
* Not all humans speak the same language, and genes do not explain cross-linguistic differences
* There is an obvious learning component to language acquisition
:::

## Is language *inherited*?

<br>
<br>

::: {.incremental}
* Language acquisition is **efficient**: Humans acquire their native language(s) in little time, without effort, and without explicit instruction
* **Stimulus poverty**: language cannot be possible learned from experience alone (lack of positive and negative evidence)
* Language is **unique to humans**, non-human animals do not acquire language even after intensive training
:::

## Current directions

<br>
<br>

Which aspects are more **experience dependent**?

**Which experience** do they depend on?

Which **mechanisms** underlie language learning?

To what extent do humans share these mechanisms with **other species**?

## Phonotactics

::: box
From 9 months of age, infants show sensitivity to phonotactics in their native language.
:::

**Friederici and Wessels (1995)**

4.5, 6 and 9 month-old Dutch native infants

Three conditions, based on their phonotacticality:

- **Legal** syllables (e.g., *bref*, *murt*)
- **Illegal onset** syllables (e.g., *rtum*)
- **Illegal coda** (e.g., *febr*)

## Phonotactics

**Friederici and Wessels (1995)**

9 month-old infants (but not younger infants) looked longer to trials in which legal syllables were presented, compared to illegal syllables.

# 12-24 months

## Vocabulary growth

From 12 months of age onwards, infants' vocabulary grows at a steady rate until 18 months of age. From 12 to 24 months, it grows much faster (*vocabulary spurt*) [@frank_wordbank:_2017; @goldfield_early_1990].

## Lexical development

<br>
<br>

Responses are faster and more accurate when **prime** and **target** words are **semantically related** (*NURSE-DOCTOR*) compared to when no prime is presented (*XXXX*) or when they are unrelated (*BIRD-CAT*).

Between 18 and 21 months, words start being represented in infants' mental lexicon in association with other phonologically and semantically related word.

# Questions

## Recap

::: incremental
* Can you provide a reasonable definition of language?
* Can you describe the main linguistic units?
* What features of language are fetuses familarized with?
* Can newborns discriminate between different languages at birth? If so, how?
* Around what ages do we specialize in the phonology of our native language? Do bilinguals follow the same path as monolinguals?
* When do we learn our first words?
* Do we learn words at a linear rate across ages?
* Does bilingualism slow down vocabulary growth?
* Around what ages does the early lexicon start sharing its core features with the adult lexicon?
