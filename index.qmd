## What is language?

<br>
<br>

No easy, complete, specific way to define language

- **Complete**: captures *all* features of language
- **Specific**: captures *only* features of language

## What is language for?

<br>

Language provides clear evolutionary advantages

## What is language for?

### Language as a tool for communication

The ability for complex thinking provided humans with the ability to learn language^[@fedorenko_language_2024; @hockett1960origin; @kirby2008cumulative].

Claims:

- Complex thinking does not necessarily engage language-related brain areas and vice versa (double dissociation)^[@fedorenko_language_2024]

## What is language for?

<br>
<br>

### Language as a tool for thinking

The ability to use language provided humans with complex thinking^[@chomsky2014minimalist; @goldin2003thought].

Claims:

- (Some forms of) thinking require or are facilitated by language [e.g., @lupyan_language_2007]

## Where does language come from?

<br>
<br>

Symbolic communication appears between 1,000,000 and 100,000 years ago (*Homo erectus*)^[@barham_semiotics_2021].

**Why? How?** Two approaches:

* Language "appears"^[@berwick2016only; @chomsky2014minimalist]
* Language develops^[@tomasello2003constructing; @christiansen2003language]

## Where does language come from?

<br>
<br>

Can only be investigated *indirectly*:

- Sparse archaeological evidence
- Cultural transmission and evolution
- Evolutionary biology

# [Language]{style="color: grey;"} acquisition


## Is language *learned*?

<br>
<br>

* Humans need exposure to language to acquire language
* Not all humans speak the same language, and genes do not explain such differences

## Is language *inherited*?

<br>
<br>

* Humans acquire their native language(s) in little time, without effort, and without explicit instruction
* *Stimulus poverty*: language cannot be possible learnt from experience alone (lack of positive and negative evidence)
* Language is unique to humans, non-human animals do not acquire language even after intensive training

## Current views on language ontogeny

<br>
<br>

Which aspects are more experience dependent?

Which experience do they depend on?

Which mechanisms underlie language learning?

To what extent do humans share these mechanisms with other species?

# Before-birth

Pre-natal language acquisition

## Acoustics in the womb

<br>
<br>

{{< video img/womb.mp4 title="Acoustics in the womb" width="800" >}}

## Acoustics in the womb

<br>
<br>

* Biological tissues filter the acoustic signal
* Low-pass filter: lower frequencies reach the fetus' ears, higher frequencies do not


## Fetal auditory development

* Auditory system functional by **24 weeks of gestation**
* Fetus' get familiarized with prosodic features of their native language(s)
    + **Intonation**: modulation of the frequency of speech sounds across segments
    + **Rhythm**: rate at which linguistic units are produce per unit of time
* Still **unfamiliar with segmental information** (i.e., different consonants)

# 0-6 months of age

* Presented newborns with low-pass filtered sentences produced by natural speakersc (keeping prosodic but not segmental information)
* Sentences belonged to a stress-timed (English, Dutch) or a mora-timed (Japanese) language

- Illegal onset (e.g., *rtum*)
- Illegal coda (e.g., *febr*)
